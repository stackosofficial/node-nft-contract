All the ways that functions are called and whether we change swap path for it in FakeRouter.

stablecoins(0) is equal to USDT on current deployed contracts.

Exchange contract uses hardcoded indexes to access elements in returned arrays from the router contract, thus our FakeRouter should return arrays that has the same length as initial 'path' passed by Exchange contract to our FakeRouter. Also getAmountIn in Exchange gets element at 0 index instead of last element like getAmountOut.  

swapExactETHForTokens: Path untouched
   matic -> WETH
   matic -> stackToken
   DEPENDS ON getAmountsOut which changes path

swapExactTokensForETH: Path untouched
   unused


   ---------- FUNCTIONS THAT CHANGE PATH ----------


swapExactTokensForTokens: Path changed
   any stablecoin -> stackToken
   DEPENDS ON getAmountsOut which changes path

getAmountIn: Path changed
   stablecoins(0) -> stackToken

getAmountOut: Path changed
   stackToken -> stablecoins(0)
   stablecoins(0) -> stackToken
