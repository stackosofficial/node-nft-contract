There is sub0, sub1, and gen0, gen1

1. Whitelist vault to transfer gen0, gen1 and so on
2. deposit function:
         require(generationId < generations.count(), "Generation doesn't exist");
         require(
            darkMatter.isOwnStackOrDarkMatter(
               msg.sender,
               generationId,
               tokenId
            ),
            "Not owner"
         );
         StackOsNFTBasic stack = StackOsNFTBasic(
            address(generations.get(generationId))
         );
         stack.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
         //  save owner of token so he can withdraw NFT later
         // should note how much subs-fee withdraw, so should save amount received or amount noted in deposits.balance (their could differ due to TAX)? 
         withdraw  // notice: will revert when there is 0 balance on NFT, maybe should use try/catch and then just note 0 has been withdrawn, or check deposits struct
         // send to vault owner whatever withdrawn
         claimBonus  // reverts if there is no bonus money on Subscription contract
         // note down withdraw fees and bonuses and tax and date
